At least that's what I'm saying.... The bartenders could use a bit more work. The food is great, but the service should be better. The waiter was very rude and unprofessional.

It's slow. The banking app crashes and it's just slow. I've used it for a while and I've been dissatisfied with it and now I have to switch from it. It's like a bank app that keeps going downhill. If you can't fix it, you won't be able to keep it up. The app won't work if you're not busy.
