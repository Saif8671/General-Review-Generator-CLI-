At least that's what I'm saying.... The bartenders could use a bit more work. The food is great, but the service should be better. The waiter was very rude and unprofessional.

It's slow. The banking app crashes and it's just slow. I've used it for a while and I've been dissatisfied with it and now I have to switch from it. It's like a bank app that keeps going downhill. If you can't fix it, you won't be able to keep it up. The app won't work if you're not busy.

I have to say, the food was a waste of time. I eat out a couple times a week and have given this place a bad review. It is a little pricey, but not a bad thing. I recommend sitting down for a quick meal at Wynn or The Venetian and you will be sat at the table that you are seated in. There are a couple of seating tables for a table that are in the middle of the restaurant. I am not sure why they do that but it is just a waste of time to sit at your table and sit down. There are some other dining options in town and it's great, but I think they should be banned from the public that are getting a bad review. One of the main points I have to say is that the food is cheap. There is a lot of it on the menu and the people are very unfriendly.
